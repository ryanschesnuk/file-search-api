            Sample Text Title

              By Somebody Someone

    This is a sample bit of text used for testing this API. We
definitely should check that we can find phrases that
span
multiple
lines. Also, we should test sentences that end in
exclamation points! This sentence is preceded with different
punctuation.

    There is also the issue of "doube quotes" which could possibly
interfere with the JSON string. Here is another sentence as an interesting
addition. We should also ask: what about
questions? There is another thing we must deal with. That other
thing is abbreviations, like Mr. Smith.

    Repeat sentences on same line. Repeat sentences on same line. We
should also check. Short sentences. On the same line to make sure
that that the correct preceeding period determines the beginning
of the sentence.
